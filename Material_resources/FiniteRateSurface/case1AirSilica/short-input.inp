surface file name | surface chemistry file name

output conv freq  | number of iterations between convergence 
                    write to STDOUT (<=0 for no output)

file save freq    | number of iterations between concentration
                    write to "output file name" (<=0 for no output)

output file name  | file to write concentration data to

Tw                | surface wall temperature (deg K)

Ptotal            | gas phase pressure (Pascals)

gas phase model   | 0 = constant volume gas phase 
                    1 = frozen gas phase concentrations (+constant volume)
                    2 = constant pressure gas phase

scan mode         | 0 = scan mode off
                    1 = scan mode on: read additional data below mole fraction record
                                      to run parametrics scans of P,T and mole fractions
                                      (turns off most diagnostics outputs)

dt                | time step/constant (seconds)

num steps         | number of iterations

time order        | 0 = explicit
                    1 = Euler implicit
                    2 = 3-pt backwards implicit

diagnostic        | 1 = compute Gibbs free energy minimization
                    2 = output finite rate diagnostics  
                    3 = output finite rate diagnostics plus write FRM system file back out

equilibrium       | -1 = compute Gibbs free-energy minimization
                         consistent with finite rate solution
                     0 = compute T,V Gibbs free-energy minimization
                     1 = compute T,V Gibbs free-energy minimization
                         with frozen gas phase species
                     2 = compute P,T Gibbs free-energy minimization

number of gas phase species | number of species to follow
                             (must match requirement in chemistry file)

name and mole fraction of each species | gas phase mole fractions

Pressure & Temperature Scan | scan records for pressure and temperature
                              (only if "scan mode" is 1)
                              (read until <0.0 is found)

Mole Fraction Scan | scan records for pressure and temperature
                     (only if "scan mode" is 1)
                     (read until <0.0 is found)
